          <div>HOW TO USE AOS SCROLL ANIMATION EFFECT IN REACT
Hi, I am Avi & today I will share a simple but powerful animation effect on React Js . Its called AOS animations.

Its simple to use like eating food & I‚Äôm not joking.

lets start form installation.

for bower 

bower install aos ‚Äî save
for npm

npm i aos ‚Äî save
for Yarn

npm i aos ‚Äî save
Now after complete the installation you need import two things in the component where you want to use the scroll animation effect >>

import AOS from "aos";
import "aos/dist/aos.css";
Then you need to initialize aos like this

export default App;
Now comes the best part . you need to go here & copy the animation into your div/image/paragraph/header anywhere you want like this. only the data-aos part.

I think it will help you to create simple scroll animation effect on your project.
